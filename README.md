# About-Me
I am a currently a Field Services/ Network engineer working on Juniper/ Cisco networks.
In my spare time I am learning Python & Bash, with a view to creating various automation scripts.
I will also be sharing none-privileged/ publicly available information about Juniper & Cisco networking products, as well as links to any training material that I find useful.

All views are my own and not those of my employer.
